# Disease-predictions-deep-learning-ML
This project will serve as an anthology for all superivised learning algoithms I have learned throughout the course of the last year or so. Multiple ML algaoritms/Deep Neural Nets were deployed/tuned/ and experimented with in order to deal with the binary classification problem of diagnosing a patient with a certain, unspecified disease. The primary focus of this work will be to tune and compare more advanced algorithms such as multilayer-perceptron ANN's to simpler, less computationally expensive shallow algorithms that we've dealt with in previous works.
